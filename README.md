# SimpleCRM
Simple .NET MVC CRM Website based on launchCode Education's 3rd Unit (back-end development)

Setting up an MVC project, copying in the models, view, view models, controllers, and startup file then adding a database connection string to the appsettings.json file will allow you to deploy the website in Visual Studio.

For extra fun, download SSRS, set up a reporting server and tables and launch that as well, and bam. Simple bare-bones CRM with reporting capabilities.
